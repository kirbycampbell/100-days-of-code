# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Social Box and CSS to BlogCreator(Medium Knockoff). Created Twitter account for coding only and began my posting-spree! Also added automatic loading to the Blog Creator page, so that previous work is auto-reloaded when returning to page.

**Thoughts:** Used some fontawesome icons and placed them on the left side of the page permanently, much like medium.com. Changed the Desktop View of my blog list to a 2-column view while adjusting spacing. Ran into a little trouble playing with the grid rows/columns - it interacted with my footer in odd ways that took some experimentation to figure out. Couldn't get the fontawesome icons any bigger, I believe that's part of the limitation of fontawesome "free" icons though. Great first day!
