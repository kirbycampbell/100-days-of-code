# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###################################################################################################

### Day 0: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Social Box and CSS to BlogCreator(Medium Knockoff).
Created Twitter account for coding only and began my posting-spree!
Also added automatic loading to the Blog Creator page, so that previous work is auto-reloaded when returning to page.

**Thoughts:** Used some fontawesome icons and placed them on the left side of the page permanently, much like medium.com.
Changed the Desktop View of my blog list to a 2-column view while adjusting spacing.
Ran into a little trouble playing with the grid rows/columns

- it interacted with my footer in odd ways that took some experimentation to figure out.
  Couldn't get the fontawesome icons any bigger,
  I believe that's part of the limitation of fontawesome "free" icons though. Great first day!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###################################################################################################

### Day 1 : March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Moved My Firestore app config in blog-store over to a .env file unsuccesfully - attempting to add Auth to my blog-store app.
Seemed like too big of a beast to tackle today, so moved onto a new app that Auth's with firestore, that I can use as an example in the app that already writes to the Firestore db

- without breaking it.  
  Also began work on a simple timer - to serve as a reminder for javascript Date functions.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck working on the Auth - as my BlogCreator has only certain pages requiring login,
and Firestore was a bit complicated in that realm.
So to accomplish something on Day 1 - I built the beginnings of a simple Timer app that I will soon build out as a nicely styled Meditation Timer.
As of now it's crude, but it's doing things!

### Day 2 : March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made minor stylizing progress with Meditation counter app -

**Thoughts:** time was crunched due to massive 10k+ power outage in portland... 12 hours without power on day 3 of 100 days of code - will do 5x the work tomorrow to make up for the city's disaster.

### Day 3 : March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ReWrote the Meditation Timer from the ground up in React Hooks as a new challenge.
Implemented a custom hook from Dan Abramov called useInterval.
Added Howl library for playing a peaceful gong sound when meditation is over.
Changed form protection - only accepts numbers from 1-140.

**Thoughts:** : Ran into some new issues with setInterval and setTimeout not functioning properly with React's new Hooks update.
Otherwise I love the new Hook's useState syntax, so visually appealing now,
and much easier to implement state changes without the "this" keyword.
Combed through several Audio libraries for react and landed on Howl

- worked great for the gong sound at the end.

### Day 4 : March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Expanded the Meditation App with Pop up Menu (hand-coded and styled) and added buttons and hamburger. Also Added a Title banner with background image. Mainly styled for mobile thus far.

**Thoughts:** : Hooks has definitely been a learning experience.
Props don't behave like they used to...
It was also pretty hard to find any examples of props being used with Hooks.
Thus far my entire project is within the App.js file since I'm avoiding breaking it down into seperate components and containers.
I need to figure that out soon, as the app is about to get much more complicated!

### Day 5 : March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Refactored The Meditation app into containers. Figured out the difference between regular React/Props and ReactHooks/Props - Passing Down UseState into the Components!

**Thoughts:** : Broke through on my props issue, Organized the project so much more! Next up is making each user selection show up and effect it's own state for the background music, the end sound, and the timer. Need to add ability to save Different Timers.
