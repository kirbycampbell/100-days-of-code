# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Social Box and CSS to BlogCreator(Medium Knockoff). Created Twitter account for coding only and began my posting-spree! Also added automatic loading to the Blog Creator page, so that previous work is auto-reloaded when returning to page.

**Thoughts:** Used some fontawesome icons and placed them on the left side of the page permanently, much like medium.com. Changed the Desktop View of my blog list to a 2-column view while adjusting spacing. Ran into a little trouble playing with the grid rows/columns - it interacted with my footer in odd ways that took some experimentation to figure out. Couldn't get the fontawesome icons any bigger, I believe that's part of the limitation of fontawesome "free" icons though. Great first day!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 : March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Moved My Firestore app config in blog-store over to a .env file unsuccesfully - attempting to add Auth to my blog-store app. Seemed like too big of a beast to tackle today, so moved onto a new app that Auth's with firestore, that I can use as an example in the app that already writes to the Firestore db - without breaking it.  
Also began work on a simple timer - to serve as a reminder for javascript Date functions.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck working on the Auth - as my BlogCreator has only certain pages requiring login, and Firestore was a bit complicated in that realm. So to accomplish something on Day 1 - I built the beginnings of a simple Timer app that I will soon build out as a nicely styled Meditation Timer. As of now it's crude, but it's doing things!
